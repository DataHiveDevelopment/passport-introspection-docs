# Introduction

These packages allow you to use a single authorization server to power the API authentication of any number of resource servers using Laravel Passport!

I know it doesn't sound interesting. I'm not that great at writing.

Stick with me for now. I promise I'll _try_ to be better.

{% hint style="warning" %}
These packages are still under development so not everything is present. You can find the original proof of concept project [over here](https://github.com/DataHiveDevelopment/Laravel-Introspection). That does work but is a bit messy and not great at telling you why something went wrong.
