# Laravel 8+

I am working on updating the examples to use Laravel 8. I will be rewriting the frontend in Tailwind. As Passport does not use Tailwind for their Vue components, I will be writing custom ones to accomdate it. Once completed, I will be publishing a Laravel 8.x compatible package and leaving dev versioning.

I plan on following Laravel's versioning for package support. So, once released, the 8.x compatible package will have version 8.0, Laravel 7.x will be version 7.0. I'll do my best to support Laravel 7.x with any changes that may occur to the 8.x version.

# Introduction

These packages allow you to use a single authorization server to power the API authentication of any number of resource servers using Laravel Passport!

I know it doesn't sound interesting. I'm not that great at writing.

Stick with me for now. I promise I'll _try_ to be better.
